If you had more damage you could kill the enemies faster.

"I got this really cool bucket somewhere..." He starts digging around in a bunch of crates. "Ah, here it is. This 
my friend, is oil. If we applied a little of this everywhere around the weapons we might get results."

"For the sake of damage I could start making the bullets out of metal. That would probably work better than wood."
The sudden realisation that you have been shooting wood all this time is just too much. You quietly sits down in 
a corner and think about nothing at all.

You see the engineer working on a bullet with something that looks like a wrench and a hammer. "You know, if I 
had actual proper tools to work the metal maybe the end result would be better. Maybe an oven." You ask him how 
in the world he has been making bullets up to this point. "Oh, with my trusty hammer and chisel." He replies.

"What if we made every bullet explode when it hits the target? That would be devastating and awesome!" At that 
moment everything strange about this man is gone and you see only a person who is one hundred percent awesome. 
The next moment he starts talking about very wierd conspiracy theories that he probably made up on the spot and 
he's back to being weird once again.

You find the engineer sitting on a stack of tires. "When I made breakfast this morning the toaster burned my
toast and I though; why not make a weapon with the same tech as these failed toasters?" You look at him in
disbelief. "I used the same pattern to deliver heatwaves as the toasters have. Except bigger. And to toast 
aliens. I call it... The Toastinator." You cringe for a couple of minutes, thanks him and walks away.

"Well, I think it's impossible to make the gun more powerful without shooting guns that shoot guns that shoots 
bullets that explode, so how about settle here for a while?" You think it's best not to give this man too many 
crazy ideas so you just leave.
